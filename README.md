The Pomodoro technique was first discovered by Francesco Cirillo. It is a time management technique that helps to manage work flow. It divides your schedule into four Pomodoros, three short breaks and one long break. You work 25 minutes (one Pomodoro), followed by a 5 min short break. After 4 Pomodoros, you take a long break of 15 minutes.
